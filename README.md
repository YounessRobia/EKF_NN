# Hybrid Extended Kalman Filter Tutorial

This project implements an advanced hybrid state estimation system that combines Extended Kalman Filtering with deep learning and uncertainty quantification. The system is demonstrated on the Lorenz attractor system with time-varying parameters.

## Features

- Traditional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
- Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)
- Hybrid EKF with neural network enhancements
- Physics-informed neural networks
- Uncertainty quantification
- Comparative analysis tools
